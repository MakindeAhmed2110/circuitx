## Project Description (for CoinMarketCap asset page)

CircuitX is a privacy-preserving DeFi platform that offers a private swap exchange on mainnet and private perpetual futures on testnet. The project uses zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and trusted execution environments (TEEs) so users can trade without exposing transaction amounts or wallet addresses on-chain.

**What CircuitX offers**

The platform has three main components. The Privacy Service provides application-level privacy via ZK proofs and TEEs. Users can create private notes, deposit assets, and receive untraceable payments through any privacy-enabled service. The Swap DEX runs on mainnet at swap.circuitx.live. It supports private trading of SOL, USDC, and other assets: users shield assets and swap without revealing amounts or addresses on the public ledger. The Perp DEX runs on testnet at testnet.circuitx.live. It offers private perpetual futures with leverage; position size, entry price, and profit-and-loss remain hidden via ZK proofs while remaining verifiable on-chain and resistant to MEV.

**Technology**

CircuitX relies on zero-knowledge proofs so that the validity of trades can be checked without disclosing sensitive data. The combination of ZK proofs and TEEs is used to deliver compliant, auditable privacy: activity can be verified for regulators or auditors without exposing user-level details. The team’s stated goal is to make this form of privacy the default for trading so that users can retain financial sovereignty.

**How it differs**

Unlike many DeFi venues where every swap size and wallet is visible on-chain, CircuitX hides trade amounts and participant identities by default while still allowing on-chain verification. The perpetual product on testnet applies the same approach to leveraged positions, so exposure and PnL are not broadcast. The project positions itself as a privacy-focused alternative for users who want execution without public surveillance of their activity.

**Token**

The CircuitX token is issued on Solana. The contract address is 2FcRaEB4NCoUvR5NNLCrPM9iTT3pGaKTh823zjFjBAGS. Tokenomics and technical documentation are available at swap.circuitx.live/tokenomics and swap.circuitx.live/docs.

**Team**

The project is developed by a small team. Mankind is listed as founder and developer; RythaGod is listed as developer. The project maintains a presence on X (@circuitx_app) and publishes code on GitHub (github.com/circuitx-dex).

**Where to use CircuitX**

The Swap DEX is live on mainnet at swap.circuitx.live. The Perp DEX is available on testnet at testnet.circuitx.live. The main website is circuitx.live. For live price and market data, the token can be viewed on CoinMarketCap’s Solana token page using the contract address above.
